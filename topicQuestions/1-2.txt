The Main Differences with desktops vs microcontrollers:
- Microcontrollers have WAY less memory
- Processing power is much smaller
- Battery life is important since they often run on tiny batteries

Workflow:
- We DON'T train neural networks on the microcontroller
- Instead, we train them on our regular computer or laptop
- like baking a cake at home and then taking it to a party lol

Size constraints:
- We need to shrink our neural network (quantization)
- Convert big decimal numbers to tiny integers
- Remove parts of the network we don't really need (pruning)

Tools:
- Use special frameworks like TensorFlow Lite for Microcontrollers or Edge Impulse
- These tools help convert our big models into tiny versions
  - They give us special code that runs well on microcontrollers

Testing:
- Test the tiny model to make sure it still works well
- Check if it fits in the microcontroller's memory
- Make sure it runs fast
- Calculate how long the battery will last
