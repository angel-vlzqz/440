deploying ML on a tiny microcontroller is different from putting it on a regular computer:

1. Size
On my laptop, I can use big frameworks like TensorFlow:
```python
import tensorflow as tf
model = tf.keras.models.load_model('my_sine_model.h5')
```

But on a microcontroller (like an Arduino Nano 33), we need smaller versions:
```cpp
#include <TensorFlowLite.h>
#include "sine_model.h"      // Our compressed model
```

2. Converting the Model
We can't copy-paste our model to the microcontroller. We need to make it smaller first:
```python
# Convert our regular model to a smaller version
import tensorflow as tf

# Convert the model to TensorFlow Lite
converter = tf.lite.TFLiteConverter.from_saved_model('my_sine_model')
converter.optimize_for_size()
tflite_model = converter.convert()

# Save it
with open('sine_model.tflite', 'wb') as f:
    f.write(tflite_model)
```

3. Running on the Microcontroller
Here's how we use it on an Arduino (super simplified):
```cpp
// Arduino code
#include <TensorFlowLite.h>

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);
}

void loop() {
  float angle = 45.0;  // Input angle
  float prediction = model.predict(angle);
  
  Serial.print("Sine of ");
  Serial.print(angle);
  Serial.print(" is about ");
  Serial.println(prediction);
  
  delay(1000);  // Wait a second
}
```

The big differences are:
- We have less memory
- Can't use Python (usually use C++)
- Need to be super careful about power usage
- Everything needs to be smaller and simpler

Testing is different too - instead of just running it on our computer, we have to:
1. Upload to the device
2. Monitor through Serial port
3. Test with real sensors
