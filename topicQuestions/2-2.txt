Key Differences for Microcontroller Implementation:

1. Resource Constraints:
   - Limited RAM (typically KB vs GB)
   - Limited processing power
   - Power consumption critical
   - Fixed-point vs floating-point math

2. Architecture Adaptations:
   - Simplified feature extraction
   - Smaller model architectures
   - Quantized weights (8-bit or less)
   - Optimized memory access patterns
   - Limited vocabulary size

3. Processing Approach:
   - Stream processing vs batch
   - Reduced sampling rates
   - Shorter analysis windows
   - Hardware-specific optimizations

4. Implementation Considerations:
   - No operating system overhead
   - Direct hardware access
   - Real-time constraints
   - Limited error recovery options
   - Firmware update challenges
