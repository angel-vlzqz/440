To design a wake word recognizer, you would first do the data collection phase, 
where diverse audio samples of the target wake 
word and non-wake words are gathered across different speakers, accents, 
and acoustic environments to ensure robust training given the noise. Next comes the feature extraction 
phase, where the raw audio is translated into acoustic features (like 
MFCCs, mel spectrograms, or filterbank energies) that are meant to capture the essential 
characteristics of speech while reducing the complexity of the problem. The model architecture design,
an appropriate neural network structure (such as CNNs, RNNs, or 
transformers) is selected and optimized for the specific wake word detection task. In the 
training phase, where the model learns to discriminate between wake word and
non-wake word using the prepared dataset, we use techniques 
like data augmentation and noise injection for better generalization. The 
optimization phase involves fine-tuning the model's hyperparameters and
apply techniques like quantization or pruning to improve efficiency. Finally, 
the evaluation and deployment phase grades the model's performance metrics (such
as false accept rate, false reject rate, and latency) and adapts accordingly based
on the constraints of the real-world deployment.
