To train a machine learning model to calculate a trigonometric function (like sine), 
we'd need pairs of input and output values. Similarly to teaching the computer by 
showing it examples of "if you give me this angle, the answer should be that."


```python
# angle_in_degrees, sine_value
0, 0.0
30, 0.5
45, 0.707
60, 0.866
90, 1.0
120, 0.866
135, 0.707
150, 0.5
180, 0.0
210, -0.5
```

The first number in each row is what we're giving the computer (the input angle in degrees)
The second number is what we want the computer to learn to answer with (the sine value)

I rounded the numbers to make it easier to read, but in real life, but you'd want more 
decimal places for accuracy ideally.
